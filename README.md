## Data Science Projects Through TripleTen

[1) Music Preferences of Two Cities](https://github.com/ChStLeGitHub/Project01-Music-Preferences-of-Two-Cities)

**Objective:** To analyze and compare the music preferences and user behavior of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville using Yandex Music data. 

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data evaluation, data preprocessing, comparative analysis, and consumer insight generation

[2) Customer Grocery Shopping Habits](https://github.com/ChStLeGitHub/Project02-Customer-Grocery-Shopping-Habits)

**Objective:** To analyze five datasets from the grocery delivery platform Instacart to provide stakeholders with insights into the shopping habits of Instacart customers.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data cleaning, data exploration, descriptive analysis, market basket analysis, and consumer insight generation

[3) Which Telecom Plan Is More Profitable?](https://github.com/ChStLeGitHub/Project03-Which-Telecom-Plan-Is-More-Profitable)

**Objective:** To conduct a preliminary analysis as well as hypothesis testing for the phone and internet provider Megaline using five datasets of client behavior to determine whether the Surf or the Ultimate prepaid plan generates more revenue.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, hypothesis testing, and consumer insight generation

[4) Software Development Tools](https://github.com/ChStLeGitHub/Project04-Software-Development-Tools)

**Objective:** To build and deploy a web application dashboard to a cloud service.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data analysis, virtual environments, web applications

[5) Video Game Sales Analysis and Forecasting](https://github.com/ChStLeGitHub/Project05-Video-Game-Sales-Analysis-and-Forecasting)

**Objective:** To conduct a comprehensive analysis of video game sales data for Ice, an online, worldwide video game store, to assist stakeholders with predicting the most successful video game releases for the upcoming calendar year.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, profile creation, hypothesis testing, and consumer insight generation

[6) Strategically Launching a Ride Share Company](https://github.com/ChStLeGitHub/Project06-Strategically-Launching-a-Ride-Share-Company)

**Objective:** To analyze Chicago's taxi and ride-sharing market by identifying the top neighborhoods for dropoffs, assessing the rankings of Chicago-based taxi companies based on ride frequency, and investigating the impact of weather conditions on ride duration to support Zuber, a new ride-sharing company, in making strategic decisions for their launch in the city.

**Skills Demonstrated:** SQL, descriptive statistics, data visualization, hypothesis testing, and consumer insight generation

[7) Which Telecom Plan Is Right For You?](https://github.com/ChStLeGitHub/Project07-Which-Telecom-Plan-Is-Right-For-You)

**Objective:** To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict for subscribers to the mobile carrier Megaline which of the two new plans (Smart or Ultra) they should switch to based on their phone and internet usage.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Machine learning and model evaluation

[8) Forecasting Bank Customer Retention and Churn](https://github.com/ChStLeGitHub/Project08-Forecasting-Bank-Customer-Retention-and-Churn)

**Objective:** To develop a machine learning model for Beta Bank that uses data of customers' demographics and behaviors to predict whether or not a customer is likely to leave the bank soon (since retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones).

**Skills Demonstrated:** Class imbalance handling (upsampling vs downsampling), data encoding, and model evaluation
